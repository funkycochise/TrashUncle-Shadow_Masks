Shadow Mask filters meant to be used with MiSTer FPGA

Previews here: https://github.com/trashuncle/TrashUncle-Shadow_Masks/wiki/TrashUncle's-Shadow-Mask-Pack-for-MiSTer-FPGA

These are ideal at 1080p, 5x Crop, 1x Mask, with V Integer Scaling.
My suggested scanline filter to go with most of these is 120 Brightness / 10 Soft. 
For those labeled Scanline FX, please disable Scanline filter.
If there are issues at other resolutions, please let me know.

There is a new folder in the sorted version that contains those tested at 1440p with no visual issues.

When choosing from my list, I suggest starting with Trinitron_Simple_Bright.txt

Each one has it's own charm, but a lot of them are just to test to see what can be done.
