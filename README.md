# TrashUncle-Shadow_Masks
Shadow Mask filters meant to be used with MiSTer FPGA

These have only been tested at 1080p, 1x, with Integer Scaling.
My suggested scanline filter to go with most of these is 120 Brightness / 10 Soft. 
For those labeled Scanline FX, please disable Scanline filter.
If there are issues at other resolutions, please let me know.

When choosing from my list, I suggest starting with Trinitron_Simple_Bright.txt

Each one has it's own charm, but a lot of them are just to test to see what can be done.
