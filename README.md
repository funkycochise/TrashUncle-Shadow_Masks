# TrashUncle-Shadow_Masks
Shadow Mask filters meant to be used with MiSTer FPGA

You can find out more info here:

You can also find out more info on how to make your own here:

I suggest starting with Trinitron_Simple_Bright.txt

Each one has it's own charm, but a lot of them are just to test to see what can be done.
