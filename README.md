# TrashUncle-Shadow_Masks
Shadow Mask filters meant to be used with MiSTer FPGA

Original Filters here:
https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/ShadowMasks_MiSTer

You can also find out more info on how to make your own here as well as some more options:

When choosing from my list, I suggest starting with Trinitron_Simple_Bright.txt

Each one has it's own charm, but a lot of them are just to test to see what can be done.
